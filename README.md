#  Efficiently Updatable Neural-Network-based Evaluation Function (NNUE) 

In 2018, Yu Nasu proposed a neural network based evaluation function for computer shogi in his 
paper "Efficiently Updatable Neural-Network-based Evaluation Function for computer Shogi".

This appraoch proved to be very powerful, and has been backported to the chess program Stockfish.

The original paper is available in Japanese.

This repo contains translations of the Japanese paper to English and German as pdf and word files
